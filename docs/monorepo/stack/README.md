# ü™õ Stack

Here is the technical stack used to carry out this project, with front end and back end technologies presented.

We use _**TypeScript**_ for the entire project, which is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the
language.

## üì¶ Package Manager

- Pnpm: A fast, disk space efficient package manager, this will enable us to install and manage our dependencies more
  efficiently.

## üíª Client

We're using the following technologies for the user interface, and we're going to present the main technologies as well
as the important libraries used:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and static website generation for
  React-based web applications, this will enable us to build our application optimised for search engines and sharing on
  social media.

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs, this will enable us to style our
  application in a more efficient way.

- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, this will enable us to validate the data we
  receive from the server and make sure it's in the right format.

- **Tanstack Query**: A data fetching library for React, this will enable us to fetch data from the server and display it
  in our application.

- **Hono Client (RPC)**: A client library that enables us to make remote procedure calls to the server, this will enable
  us to interact with the server and get the data we need.

- **Jest**: A JavaScript test framework focused on simplicity, which will allow us to test our application and make sure
  it works as expected.

## üì≤ Mobile

- **Expo (ReactNative)**: A framework and platform for universal React applications, this will enable us to build our
  application for both iOS and Android.

## üîå Server

- **Hono**: It's a backend framework that lets you build web applications and APIs. It's very lightweight, so you can
  build your application quickly and efficiently. It offers us a wide range of third-party libraries directly
  implemented with the framework, and it's runtime agnostic, which gives us a fairly flexible environment.

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system, this will enable us to store our data in a
  structured way.

- **Sentry**: A monitoring platform that helps us discover, triage, and prioritize errors in real-time, this will enable
  us to monitor our application and make sure it's working as expected.

- **DrizzleORM**: A simple, lightweight ORM for Node.js, this will enable us to interact with our database and make
  queries in a more efficient way.

- **Jest**: A JavaScript test framework focused on simplicity, which will allow us to test our application and make sure
  it works as expected.

- **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. This will
  enable
  us to store our data in memory and make our application faster.

## üõú Versioning

- **GitHub**: A code hosting platform for version control and collaboration, this will enable us to store our code and
  collaborate with other developers.

## üê≥ DevOps

- **Docker**: A set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages
  called containers, this will enable us to build our application in a container and deploy it to the cloud.

- **Compose**: It' a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, this will enable us to define
  our application in a single file and run it with a single command.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool that helps us automate our software development workflows, this will enable us to
  build, test and deploy our application automatically.

- **K3s**: A lightweight Kubernetes distribution, this will enable us to deploy our application to the cloud and make it
  accessible to the public.

- **Terraform**: An open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage
  hundreds of cloud services, this will enable us to define our infrastructure in code and deploy it to the cloud.

- **ArgoCD**: A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, this will enable us to deploy our application
  to the cloud and make it accessible to the public.

- **Grafana**: A multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application, this will enable us
  to monitor our application and make sure it's working as expected.

- **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, this will enable us to monitor our application and make
  sure it's working as expected.

## üîë Security

- **Dependabot**: A tool that helps you keep your dependencies up to date, this will enable us to keep our dependencies
  up to date and avoid security vulnerabilities.

- **ESLint**: A tool to identify and report patterns found in the code, with the aim of making the code more consistent
  and avoiding bugs. This will enable us to have a uniform code that respects the following constraints

## üåê Hosting

- **Azure with K8s**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and
  manage clusters. This will enable us to deploy our application to the cloud and make it accessible to the public.

## üî® Tools

- **Husky**: A tool that lets us run scripts in response to git events, this will enable us to run scripts when we commit.

- **Lint-Staged**: A tool that lets us run linters on staged files, this will enable us to run linters on the files we
  commit.

- **Commitlint**: A tool that lets us lint our commit messages, this will enable us to write commit messages in a more
  consistent way.
